# kingshark 386 style Bootstrap Theme
It's a 386/8bit/pixel style of UI theme based on Bootstrap 3.3.7

## Intro
based on original bootstrap 3.3.7 scss files, modified some variables/mixins/functions.
Also some ideas are from [https://github.com/kristopolous/BOOTSTRA.386](https://github.com/kristopolous/BOOTSTRA.386), but mine is scss based, and details are different.

## Usage
refer to [https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.3/getting-started/#grunt](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.3/getting-started/#grunt)

You can use grunt/gulp to compile scss and js
